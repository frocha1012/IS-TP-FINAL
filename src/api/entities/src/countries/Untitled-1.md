 **Prisma Schema File**

This is a Prisma schema file, which defines the structure of our database. It uses the PostgreSQL database provider and defines a single model called `Countries`.

**Model: Countries**

The `Countries` model has the following fields:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each country, generated using the `uuid()` function.
- `name`: The name of the country, which is a unique field.
- `geom`: A field for storing the geometry of the country, such as its borders. This field is optional and can be stored as a string or bytes.
- `created_on`: The date and time when the country was created, which is automatically set to the current time using the `now()` function.
- `updated_on`: The date and time when the country was last updated, which is also automatically set to the current time using the `now()` function.

**Code Snippets**

Here are some code snippets that show how to use the `Countries` model:

```
// Create a new country
const country = await prisma.countries.create({
  data: {
    name: 'United States',
    geom: '{"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-124.482, 49.001], [-66.945, 49.001], [-66.945, 24.949], [-124.482, 24.949], [-124.482, 49.001]]]}',
  },
});

// Retrieve all countries
const countries = await prisma.countries.findMany();

// Update a country
const updatedCountry = await prisma.countries.update({
  where: {
    id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000',
  },
  data: {
    name: 'Canada',
  },
});

// Delete a country
await prisma.countries.delete({
  where: {
    id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000',
